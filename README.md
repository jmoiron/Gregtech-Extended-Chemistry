# Gregtech: Extended Chemistry: Extended

This is a fork of [Gregtech: Extended Chemistry](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtech-extended-chemistry), which is no longer maintained.

Comparison to GT:EC:

* retain monazite, bastnasite & platinum chains (with fixes)
* keep compatible with changes in [GTCEu Modern](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Modern)
* remove echo circuit / naquadah stubs which were never in a state to impact gameplay

Credit to the original author, [NemEzanevem](https://github.com/NemEzanevem) for doing most of the design and implementation.
